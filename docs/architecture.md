# Architecture

[中文](zh-CN/architecture.md) · [README](../README.md)

Workboard is a trusted Paseo plugin with separate client and server entries. The daemon owns task data and automation. Each client renders the selected host's board and keeps only its display preferences locally.

## Identity and state

A task has a plugin-generated ID. An unbound draft has no `workspaceId`; a bound task is unique by host and workspace ID. Names, branches and paths do not establish identity. Multiple agents in one workspace remain one task.

The daemon imports every active workspace across all pages. A workspace without a managed group label enters the configured default group without a label write, falling back to the first Inbox group when the configured destination is absent, unset or terminal. Default destinations exclude Done/Canceled; saving such a default or changing the selected group to a terminal type is refused without making stored data unparseable. Explicit managed labels select groups; multiple managed labels produce a visible conflict. Unrelated labels are preserved. Archived workspaces that Workboard never observed are not backfilled.

Groups have stable IDs, a name, a managed label, a semantic type and an optional color. Display order and color are independent of type. Types control draft destinations, in-progress sidebar pinning and terminal archive eligibility. At least one Inbox, Todo and Canceled group remain. Deletion distinguishes task occupancy from default destination use, requiring tasks to be moved or the default to be changed. New drafts may default to any Todo-type group; absent or invalid destinations keep the first-by-type fallback. Start work separately resolves `defaultStartWorkGroup` to a configured In progress group, then the first such group, or no destination. Both StartModal and the server use this resolver, preserving pending binding and explicit-stage intent. `defaultStartGroup` retains only the unlabeled-import meaning. Missing current data and all v1–v7 migrations initialize the new preference to null without copying the import default. Kind/ID validation happens when saving settings; invalid stored preferences remain readable. Client deletion hints and server validation require switching an explicitly selected working default before deleting its group or changing its type.

Agent activity is a separate projection. A reply finishing never marks a task done. PR/MR information comes from Paseo's workspace data; Workboard does not poll forge services or implement a separate merge detector.

## Persistence and concurrency

Host settings store schema version 8, including tasks, groups, preferences, binding/archive intents and owned pin timestamps. Version 6 splits the conversation record into display evidence and gate evidence; version 7 adds the archive delay, default destinations and task-level `mergedDrafts` arrays (empty for historical tasks). The store validates data and writes against the host settings revision. Migrations preserve existing records; unsupported or invalid data stops initialization and automatic retries, with a visible board error. Transient connection failures still retry every ten seconds. Data is never silently replaced. Migration from v5 skips historical agent IDs without observation times, and v6→v7 removes existing entries without observation times so real scans can rediscover them. Legacy settings without a Canceled group gain one with an ID and label that do not collide with existing configured groups; existing groups, tasks and order remain. This repair turns automatic archive off, since migration cannot inspect ordinary labels on host workspaces. A persisted `archiveMappingNeedsReview` flag keeps the bilingual explanation visible until archive is re-enabled through the existing due-task confirmation flow. Normal migrations retain the original archive preference. Versions 1–7 follow the existing chain through to v8.

Column card ordering lives in the v8 Data and Board top-level `cardOrderByStage` map, separate from task records and settings. Both client and server use the shared pure sorter. Reorder/reset mutations compare the complete unfiltered projected column inside the server serial queue and Store update; only archived/external records are hidden, while pending/uncertain archives and bindings remain as immovable neighbors. Reordering moves one eligible task, retains every other task's relative order, and writes only the order map. Missing IDs are ignored until they return; a subsequent reorder compacts current membership. Deleting a group clears its key. v7→v8 defaults the map to empty, and older migrations continue through that step.

One server-side queue serializes mutations and reconciliation. Subscriptions coalesce affected workspace changes, and a 60-second refresh reconciles missed events. Polling clients do not own archive timers. The client uses optimistic stage changes, then confirms or rolls back using the server result.

Group edits and ordering use expected configuration values to reject stale writes. Task edits check `updatedAt`; status changes check the managed labels they were based on. Concurrent native edits can still occur after the final check because Paseo 0.9.1 does not provide a conditional atomic label/archive operation.

Client writes track pending control IDs, rejecting repeat submissions from that control with localized feedback while allowing unrelated requests. The server remains responsible for optimistic concurrency. Mutation responses only replace cached data when their revision is at least as new as the cache. Confirmations retain a visible failure slot on false results or exceptions. Error text maps every static server error and known issue, with a localized generic fallback for dynamic or unknown errors.

Successful cross-group moves share an eight-second card highlight and inline undo window. Undo sends only a reverse `stage` mutation with the successful managed labels as its expectation. Polling card changes or expiry invalidate it; a native label conflict rejects it visibly. It does not change archive paths or bypass gates. Conflict resolution lacks a single previous group and cannot use this reversal; group ordering keeps its existing reverse-by-reordering interaction.

Filters update the controlled view immediately and debounce client storage by 300ms, flushing dirty values when leaving. Conflict notices use the same filters and separate counts. Column header reorder requires Alt/Meta arrows, and its action label describes group options; drag instructions are separate hints. Tooltip timers clear on dismissal/unmount. The native settings surface omits board navigation.

## Draft binding

Creating a draft writes only plugin data. A create request may select any Todo-type group; omitted groups use the default Todo target.

Starting work persists an operation ID and uses Paseo's idempotent workspace creation. It either creates a workspace without an agent or attaches an existing one. The workspace link is retained if label synchronization fails, so retrying does not create another workspace. Attaching an already imported workspace merges the draft into its existing card and preserves notes while recording the original draft ID, title, description, merge time and appended text. `detach-draft` checks the surviving task’s `updatedAt`, removes only a unique match of the original appended text, restores an unbound draft with its original ID, and removes that source record. Multiple sources can be restored independently. Edited or ambiguous text, an occupied original ID, or an archived survivor rejects the operation while keeping its data and source records. A failed binding can be retried or canceled using its expected operation ID. Cancellation rejects executing or queued bindings and retains any created or linked workspace.

## Automation safeguards

Sidebar pinning is enabled by default and follows the `in-progress` group type. Workboard records the exact `pinnedAt` value returned by Paseo. It removes only a pin it still owns; an existing or manually replaced pin remains. A user removing an automatic pin suppresses repinning until the task leaves and re-enters that type.

Automatic archive is disabled by default. Eligibility requires a Done/Canceled-type group and strictly more than the configured `archiveAfterDays` (30 by default, an integer from 1 to 365) since the latest verified user or assistant message across the workspace's agents. Changing labels, editing notes or importing a workspace does not reset this clock. Drafts and workspaces without conversation evidence do not qualify.

Each agent's conversation is stored as two separate values: the time a card shows, and the gate automatic archive may use. Display evidence is either an exact user or assistant message, a lower bound (`≥`, Paseo's recorded user message or the oldest rows of a partially replayed window) or an upper bound (`≤`, Paseo's recorded activity). Gate evidence is exact, or Paseo's recorded activity as an upper bound, which is never earlier than the real last message and therefore can only delay an archive. A lower bound never gates. Paseo re-stamps replayed history with the hydration moment, so rows newer than the recorded activity are dropped as hydration stamps instead of failing the workspace; a recorded observation also stays a lower bound, never a gate.

The server rechecks labels, activity and workspace safety before calling native archive. Active agents, terminals, scripts, history without a provable bound or unsafe Git state defer the operation. Git checks do not repair the working tree or push changes. The persisted archive intent becomes uncertain after a timeout or interrupted operation; it is not blindly retried. Success requires a native success response and disappearance from a refreshed active workspace list.

Blocked candidates back off in memory by reason, doubling from one minute to a maximum of one hour. Relevant inventory changes trigger rechecking, and a different reason observed during a check resets the delay. Deferred tasks reuse conversation evidence without repeated timeline replay or Git checks. Each scan shares one inventory read; pre-send and post-success confirmations remain independent. Restart clears the backoff.

The archive page can confirm uncertain or external outcomes as archived, or clear their record and return the task to the board. Requests check the task update timestamp and archive operation ID; restoration to a deleted group is refused while its record is retained. User confirmation does not call native archive or invent a native archive time. Restoration retains the workspace association; an absent workspace shows as unavailable while the task stays on the board until native inventory rediscovers it. It does not restore a native workspace or directory. All automatic archive gates still apply. Archived drafts can also be restored using the same timestamp and operation ID checks. They return to the original group after clearing the archive record; deletion or a type that no longer accepts drafts blocks restoration and keeps the record.

Native archive may stop agents/terminals and remove a managed worktree. Workboard records archive status but does not guarantee directory cleanup or restoration. Paseo's independent archive-on-merge setting remains under Paseo's control.

## Compatibility boundary

The public SDK does not expose every required operation. The compatibility module uses the plugin's existing authenticated IPC session for labels, pins, settings writes, bootstrap and selected history/record queries. It does not create a second login, replace credentials or modify Paseo.

The manifest owns the minimum Paseo version. The bridge validates response shapes but does not pin a host version. Later versions may require a compatibility change; record tested hosts and remaining limits in [verification](verification.md) and the Cafe listing.

The runtime uses the fixed plugin ID `paseo-workboard`; install it without an `--id` override.

Client imports use Paseo-provided React, React Native, TanStack Query, Zod and plugin modules. The server uses the provided SDK/Zod and Node built-ins. The published package contains TypeScript sources; Paseo prepares them, so there is no build step or runtime npm dependency installation.

## Client preferences

Paseo 0.9.1 has no public plugin locale API. `client/paseo-language.ts` reads the Web/Electron app's `@paseo:app-settings` language, with its legacy key as a fallback, without writing host settings. It uses Paseo's system-locale selection rules and translates Chinese or English. While a surface is mounted, storage/focus events and a one-second check observe changes in the same window. Revalidate this private storage contract when upgrading Paseo. Clients without that storage, including native mobile, fall back to English.

Column widths, collapsed columns and filters are stored per host in browser `localStorage`, independently from daemon settings. Storage failures leave the current view usable. These preferences are not synchronized between clients. Native mobile persistence and touch behavior are outside the verified platform coverage.

See [verification](verification.md) for evidence and [contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for changes to these boundaries.
